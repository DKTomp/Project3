## Project Overview: 
This application allows the user to fill out a form with a task on target date for completion and submit it. Once submitted the task appears in a table where the user can view, toggle between complete and uncomplete, or delete the task. The user can choose to view all tasks, completed tasks, or uncompleted tasks. There is a second page with a controlled contact form.
